// Best of Two
  
// Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each player rolls a standard six-sided die three times. The score of a player is calculated as the sum of the two highest rolls. The player with the higher score wins. If both players have the same score, the game ends in a tie.

// Determine the winner of the game or if it is a tie.

// Input Format
// The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
// Each test case contains six space-separated integers A1,A2,A3,B1,B2 and B3 â€” the values Alice gets in her 3 dice rolls, followed by the values which Bob gets in his 3 dice rolls.
  
// Output Format
// For each test case, output on a new line Alice if Alice wins, Bob if Bob wins and Tie in case of a tie.
// Note that you may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings tie, TIE, Tie, and tIe are considered identical.
